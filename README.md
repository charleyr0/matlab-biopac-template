# matlab-biopac-template
This is a minimal example experiment. Currently it includes just the calibration stage of an experiment.

### Requirements
Other working software combinations are available, but if you're downloading everything anyway, perhaps use the same versions that I am using to develop this:
- Matlab R2023b
- Psychtoolbox version 3.0.19.7
- gstreamer 1.22.5

### How to run
Run the experiment.m script in MATLAB.
